# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements standardized HTTP request metrics for the GlobeCo Trade Service that can be exported to the OpenTelemetry (Otel) Collector. The implementation will provide consistent observability across the microservice by tracking HTTP request patterns, performance, and load characteristics through three core metrics: request counters, duration histograms, and in-flight request gauges.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to monitor HTTP request counts across all endpoints, so that I can track service usage patterns and identify high-traffic endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request is completed THEN the system SHALL increment a counter metric named `http_requests_total`
2. WHEN recording the counter metric THEN the system SHALL include labels for method, path, and status
3. WHEN labeling the method THEN the system SHALL use uppercase HTTP method names (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
4. WHEN labeling the path THEN the system SHALL use route patterns instead of actual URLs with parameters (e.g., "/api/users/{id}" not "/api/users/123")
5. WHEN labeling the status THEN the system SHALL convert numeric HTTP status codes to strings ("200", "404", "500")

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want to measure HTTP request durations, so that I can identify slow endpoints and monitor response time trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request starts THEN the system SHALL begin timing the request duration
2. WHEN an HTTP request completes THEN the system SHALL record the duration in a histogram metric named `http_request_duration_seconds`
3. WHEN recording duration THEN the system SHALL measure from request entry to response completion in seconds with floating point precision
4. WHEN creating the histogram THEN the system SHALL use buckets: [0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10]
5. WHEN recording the histogram metric THEN the system SHALL include the same labels as the counter metric (method, path, status)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a capacity planner, I want to monitor concurrent HTTP requests, so that I can understand current load and plan for scaling needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request begins processing THEN the system SHALL increment a gauge metric named `http_requests_in_flight`
2. WHEN an HTTP request completes processing THEN the system SHALL decrement the in-flight gauge regardless of success or failure
3. WHEN creating the gauge metric THEN the system SHALL not include any labels
4. WHEN the service starts THEN the gauge SHALL initialize to zero

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want to scrape metrics from a standard endpoint, so that I can collect metrics data for analysis and alerting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service is running THEN the system SHALL expose a `/metrics` endpoint
2. WHEN the `/metrics` endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL return metrics in Prometheus text format
3. WHEN returning metrics THEN the system SHALL include all HTTP request metrics plus standard JVM/process metrics
4. WHEN the metrics endpoint fails THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without affecting request processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want metrics collection to be transparent, so that it doesn't interfere with normal application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics collection is active THEN the system SHALL record metrics for ALL HTTP requests including API endpoints, health checks, and error responses
2. WHEN metric recording fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing the request normally
3. WHEN implementing metrics THEN the system SHALL minimize performance overhead
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL properly initialize and register all metrics
5. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL ensure metrics recording does not create high-cardinality label combinations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want metrics to integrate with our existing OpenTelemetry infrastructure, so that I can use our standard monitoring and alerting tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL be compatible with the existing Otel Collector
2. WHEN implementing metrics THEN the system SHALL follow OpenTelemetry semantic conventions where applicable
3. WHEN the service is deployed THEN metrics SHALL appear in monitoring dashboards with expected patterns and values
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be properly aggregated across service instances
