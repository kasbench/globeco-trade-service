# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a new bulk trade orders API endpoint to improve performance when submitting multiple trade orders simultaneously. The current single trade order submission process is too slow for high-volume scenarios. The new POST `/api/v1/tradeOrders/bulk` endpoint will accept an array of trade orders and process them as a single atomic transaction for optimal performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trading system client, I want to submit multiple trade orders in a single API call, so that I can improve throughput and reduce the time required for bulk trade submissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a POST request to `/api/v1/tradeOrders/bulk` with an array of TradeOrderPostDTO objects THEN the system SHALL accept the request and process all trade orders
2. WHEN the bulk submission is successful THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200/201 with an array of TradeOrderResponseDTO objects corresponding to each submitted trade order
3. WHEN the bulk submission contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with detailed error messages
4. WHEN a database error occurs during bulk processing THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with appropriate error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trading system administrator, I want bulk trade order submissions to be processed atomically, so that either all orders succeed or all orders fail together to maintain data consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a bulk trade order submission THEN the system SHALL use a single database transaction for all insertions
2. IF any trade order in the bulk submission fails validation or insertion THEN the system SHALL rollback the entire transaction
3. WHEN the bulk transaction succeeds THEN all trade orders SHALL be persisted to the trade_order table
4. WHEN the bulk transaction fails THEN no trade orders from that submission SHALL be persisted

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trading system client, I want the bulk API to provide detailed error information, so that I can understand and resolve issues with failed submissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bulk submission fails due to validation errors THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages identifying which trade orders failed and why
2. WHEN a bulk submission fails due to database errors THEN the system SHALL log sufficient details for troubleshooting
3. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL include request identifiers, error details, and relevant context information
4. WHEN returning error responses THEN the system SHALL use appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for client errors, 500 for server errors)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trading system operator, I want the bulk trade orders API to handle high-volume submissions efficiently, so that it doesn't become a performance bottleneck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing bulk trade orders THEN the system SHALL use optimized database operations (single INSERT statement with multiple values)
2. WHEN handling large arrays of trade orders THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable response times
3. WHEN processing bulk submissions THEN the system SHALL minimize memory usage and avoid unnecessary object creation
4. WHEN multiple bulk requests are received concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without degrading performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trading system integrator, I want the bulk API to follow the same patterns as the existing single trade order API, so that integration is straightforward and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the bulk API THEN the system SHALL use the existing TradeOrderPostDTO structure for input validation
2. WHEN returning successful responses THEN the system SHALL use the existing TradeOrderResponseDTO structure for each created trade order
3. WHEN validating trade orders THEN the system SHALL apply the same business rules as the single trade order endpoint
4. WHEN handling authentication and authorization THEN the system SHALL use the same security mechanisms as existing endpoints
