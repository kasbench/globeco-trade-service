# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has multiple TaskExecutor beans configured which is causing Spring Boot to issue a warning about ambiguous bean selection for async processing. This needs to be resolved to ensure proper async execution behavior and eliminate configuration warnings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to start without configuration warnings, so that I can be confident the async processing is properly configured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL NOT log warnings about multiple TaskExecutor beans
2. WHEN async methods are executed THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate TaskExecutor based on the operation type
3. WHEN the default async processing is needed THEN the system SHALL use a clearly designated primary TaskExecutor

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of concerns for different types of async operations, so that I can ensure optimal performance for each operation type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN execution submissions are processed THEN the system SHALL use the executionSubmissionExecutor
2. WHEN metrics are recorded THEN the system SHALL use the metricsRecordingExecutor  
3. WHEN scheduled tasks are executed THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate scheduler configuration
4. WHEN generic async operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use a designated primary executor

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want explicit configuration of which TaskExecutor serves as the primary bean, so that the async behavior is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple TaskExecutor beans exist THEN one SHALL be marked as @Primary
2. WHEN the primary TaskExecutor is selected THEN it SHALL be appropriate for general-purpose async operations
3. WHEN reviewing the configuration THEN the primary executor choice SHALL be documented with clear reasoning
