# Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This document consolidates the most critical performance optimization requirements for the Globeco Trade Service to address performance slowdown under load. The primary issues identified are transaction commit delays (4-13 seconds under load), database connection pool contention, and inefficient external service integration patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Connection Pool Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized database connection pool settings, so that the service can handle high concurrent load without connection timeouts or excessive wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is under high load THEN the database connection pool SHALL maintain utilization below 80%
2. WHEN connection pool exhaustion occurs THEN the system SHALL fail fast with connection timeout under 10 seconds
3. WHEN connections are idle THEN the pool SHALL automatically manage connection lifecycle with appropriate timeouts
4. WHEN connection leaks occur THEN the system SHALL detect and log them within 30 seconds
5. IF the maximum pool size is reached THEN new requests SHALL timeout within 10 seconds rather than waiting indefinitely

### Requirement 2: Transaction Scope Reduction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reduced transaction scope for database operations, so that lock contention is minimized and transaction commit times are under 1 second.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing trade order submission THEN each database operation SHALL use separate short-lived transactions
2. WHEN external service calls are made THEN they SHALL occur outside of database transactions
3. WHEN transaction commit occurs THEN it SHALL complete within 1 second under normal load
4. WHEN multiple database operations are required THEN they SHALL be coordinated without holding long-running transactions
5. IF transaction rollback is needed THEN only the specific failed operation SHALL be rolled back

### Requirement 3: Database Query Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast database query execution, so that API responses are returned within acceptable time limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common query patterns are executed THEN appropriate database indexes SHALL be available
2. WHEN slow queries are detected (>1 second) THEN they SHALL be logged and monitored
3. WHEN batch operations are performed THEN Hibernate batch processing SHALL be enabled with appropriate batch sizes
4. WHEN query execution plans are analyzed THEN they SHALL use indexes efficiently
5. IF query performance degrades THEN database statistics SHALL be automatically updated

### Requirement 4: External Service Integration Optimization

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want fast response times for enhanced endpoints, so that external service calls don't significantly impact performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple external service calls are needed THEN they SHALL be executed in parallel
2. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN circuit breakers SHALL prevent cascading failures
3. WHEN external service responses are cached THEN cache hit rates SHALL exceed 80%
4. WHEN external service calls timeout THEN they SHALL fail within 5 seconds for connection and 10 seconds for read
5. IF external services are slow THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses or graceful degradation

### Requirement 5: HTTP Metrics Filter Performance

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want efficient HTTP metrics collection, so that metrics gathering doesn't add significant overhead to request processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP requests are processed THEN metrics recording SHALL add less than 10ms overhead per request
2. WHEN metrics are recorded THEN they SHALL be processed asynchronously to avoid blocking requests
3. WHEN path normalization occurs THEN results SHALL be cached to avoid repeated processing
4. WHEN metrics builders are created THEN they SHALL be pre-configured to avoid runtime overhead
5. IF metrics recording fails THEN it SHALL not impact request processing

### Requirement 6: JVM Memory and Garbage Collection Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized JVM settings, so that garbage collection pauses don't impact application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN garbage collection occurs THEN pause times SHALL be under 200ms for 95% of collections
2. WHEN heap memory is allocated THEN it SHALL be sized appropriately for the workload (4-8GB)
3. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN it SHALL remain below 70% of allocated heap under normal load
4. WHEN G1GC is used THEN it SHALL be configured for low-latency requirements
5. IF memory leaks occur THEN they SHALL be detected through monitoring and heap analysis

### Requirement 7: Caching Strategy Enhancement

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want optimized caching for external service data, so that repeated calls are minimized and response times are improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security data is requested THEN it SHALL be cached with appropriate TTL (10 minutes)
2. WHEN portfolio data is requested THEN it SHALL be cached with extended TTL (15 minutes)
3. WHEN cache hit rates are measured THEN they SHALL exceed 80% for both security and portfolio data
4. WHEN cache warming occurs THEN frequently accessed data SHALL be pre-loaded on application startup
5. IF cache performance degrades THEN metrics SHALL be collected and analyzed for optimization

### Requirement 8: Asynchronous Processing Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want asynchronous processing for non-critical operations, so that request threads are not blocked by slow operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external service submissions occur THEN they SHALL be processed asynchronously
2. WHEN metrics recording happens THEN it SHALL use dedicated thread pools
3. WHEN batch operations are performed THEN they SHALL use parallel processing where appropriate
4. WHEN async operations fail THEN they SHALL be retried with exponential backoff
5. IF async thread pools are exhausted THEN operations SHALL be queued or rejected gracefully

### Requirement 9: Database Infrastructure Tuning

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want optimized PostgreSQL configuration, so that the database can handle concurrent load efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent connections are active THEN PostgreSQL SHALL support up to 200 connections
2. WHEN shared buffers are configured THEN they SHALL be sized appropriately (256MB minimum)
3. WHEN checkpoint operations occur THEN they SHALL be optimized to reduce I/O spikes
4. WHEN lock timeouts are configured THEN they SHALL prevent indefinite waits (30 seconds maximum)
5. IF deadlocks occur THEN they SHALL be detected and resolved within 1 second

### Requirement 10: Performance Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive performance monitoring, so that performance issues can be detected and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include API response times, database performance, and cache hit rates
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN alerts SHALL be triggered automatically
3. WHEN slow queries are detected THEN they SHALL be logged with execution plans
4. WHEN connection pool utilization is high THEN monitoring SHALL provide visibility into usage patterns
5. IF performance degrades THEN historical metrics SHALL be available for trend analysis

### Requirement 11: Load Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive load testing capabilities, so that performance optimizations can be validated under realistic conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load tests are executed THEN they SHALL simulate realistic concurrent user patterns
2. WHEN performance baselines are established THEN they SHALL include 95th percentile response times under 500ms
3. WHEN optimization changes are made THEN they SHALL be validated through before/after load testing
4. WHEN performance regressions are detected THEN they SHALL be identified through automated testing
5. IF load test results show degradation THEN rollback procedures SHALL be available

### Requirement 12: Configuration Management for Performance Settings

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want externalized performance configuration, so that settings can be tuned without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance settings are changed THEN they SHALL be configurable through application properties
2. WHEN different environments are deployed THEN they SHALL have environment-specific performance configurations
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be applied without requiring application restart where possible
4. WHEN performance tuning is needed THEN configuration SHALL support A/B testing of different settings
5. IF configuration errors occur THEN the application SHALL start with safe default values
