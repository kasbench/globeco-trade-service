# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces the current one-by-one execution submission process with a bulk submission mechanism to improve performance and reduce overhead when posting executions to the GlobeCo Execution Service. The current ExecutionServiceImpl.submitExecution method creates significant overhead under load by making individual API calls to POST /api/v1/executions. This enhancement will implement bulk submissions using the Execution Service's POST /api/v1/executions/batch API, with configurable batch sizes up to 100 executions per request.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trading system, I want to submit multiple executions to the Execution Service in bulk, so that I can reduce API overhead and improve performance under high load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple executions need to be submitted THEN the system SHALL use the POST /api/v1/executions/batch API endpoint instead of individual POST /api/v1/executions calls
2. WHEN batch submissions are made THEN each batch SHALL contain a maximum of 100 executions as per the API limit
3. WHEN the batch size limit is configured THEN it SHALL be externally configurable through application properties
4. WHEN executions are submitted in bulk THEN the system SHALL maintain the same data integrity as individual submissions
5. WHEN bulk submission succeeds THEN all executions in the batch SHALL be marked as submitted with appropriate status updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable batch sizes for execution submissions, so that I can optimize performance based on system capacity and load patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring batch size THEN the system SHALL read the value from application properties with a default of 100
2. WHEN the configured batch size exceeds 100 THEN the system SHALL enforce the API maximum limit of 100
3. WHEN the configured batch size is less than 1 THEN the system SHALL use a default value of 50
4. WHEN batch processing occurs THEN executions SHALL be grouped into batches of the configured size
5. IF there are remaining executions after full batches THEN they SHALL be submitted in a final partial batch

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trading system operator, I want detailed error handling for bulk execution submissions, so that I can identify and resolve issues with failed submissions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Execution Service returns HTTP 201 THEN all executions in the batch SHALL be considered successfully submitted
2. WHEN the Execution Service returns HTTP 207 THEN the system SHALL process individual execution results to identify successes and failures
3. WHEN the Execution Service returns HTTP 400 THEN all executions in the batch SHALL be marked as failed with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN individual executions fail within a batch THEN only the failed executions SHALL be marked as failed while successful ones are updated appropriately
5. WHEN processing batch responses THEN the system SHALL map individual execution results back to the original execution records using the request index

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want retry logic for bulk execution submissions, so that transient failures don't result in permanent submission failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bulk submission fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL retry the entire batch using exponential backoff
2. WHEN a bulk submission returns HTTP 5xx errors THEN the system SHALL retry the entire batch up to the configured retry limit
3. WHEN individual executions fail within a successful batch response THEN failed executions SHALL be retried individually or in smaller batches
4. WHEN retry attempts are exhausted THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and mark executions as failed
5. WHEN retries succeed THEN the system SHALL update execution status and log successful recovery

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trading system, I want all existing execution submission functionality to be migrated to use bulk processing, so that performance improvements are realized across all submission scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the existing submitExecution(Integer id) method is called THEN it SHALL internally use the new bulk submission mechanism with a batch size of 1
2. WHEN multiple executions are submitted simultaneously THEN they SHALL be automatically batched together for optimal performance
3. WHEN the ExecutionService interface is updated THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing callers
4. WHEN new bulk submission methods are added THEN they SHALL follow the same transaction and caching patterns as existing methods
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN no direct calls to POST /api/v1/executions SHALL remain in the codebase

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system monitor, I want comprehensive logging and metrics for bulk execution submissions, so that I can track performance improvements and identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bulk submissions are made THEN the system SHALL log batch size, execution time, and success/failure counts
2. WHEN individual executions fail within a batch THEN the system SHALL log specific failure details with execution IDs
3. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL include batch processing times and throughput improvements
4. WHEN errors occur during bulk processing THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for troubleshooting
5. WHEN bulk submissions complete THEN success and failure metrics SHALL be recorded for monitoring and alerting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a trading system integrator, I want the bulk submission implementation to handle the Execution Service API response format correctly, so that execution status updates are accurate and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing BatchExecutionResponseDTO responses THEN the system SHALL correctly parse the status, message, and results fields
2. WHEN mapping ExecutionResultDTO entries THEN the system SHALL use the requestIndex to match results with original executions
3. WHEN successful executions are processed THEN the system SHALL extract the execution service ID and update local records
4. WHEN execution status updates are made THEN they SHALL follow the same patterns as the existing single submission logic
5. WHEN version conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide appropriate error messages
