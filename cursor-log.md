**User Request:** Please proceed with Phase 1 of @supplemental-requirement-7.md
**Action Taken:** Implementing Phase 1 of supplemental requirement 7 - Automated Execution Submission. This involves modifying the TradeOrderService.submitTradeOrder() method signature to include noExecuteSubmit parameter, implementing execution submission logic with compensating transaction rollback, adding retry logic with exponential backoff, and updating BatchTradeOrderService to support the new parameter.
**Files Modified:** 
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/TradeOrderService.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/TradeOrderServiceImpl.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/BatchTradeOrderService.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/config/RetryConfig.java
**Outcome:** Phase 1 service layer implementation completed successfully. Updated TradeOrderService interface to include noExecuteSubmit parameter with default method for backward compatibility, modified TradeOrderServiceImpl to implement automated execution submission with retry logic and compensating transactions, enhanced RetryConfig with exponential backoff configuration, and updated BatchTradeOrderService to support the new parameter. All changes compile successfully.
