---

**Request:** Troubleshoot why optimistic concurrency tests for the Blotter entity are not throwing exceptions as expected. Investigate test configuration, entity setup, and test code.

**Actions:**
- Searched for optimistic concurrency test code in repository and service layer tests.
- Reviewed Blotter entity for @Version annotation and configuration.
- Checked main and test datasource configuration for H2 or PostgreSQL usage.
- Confirmed that @DataJpaTest is used (defaults to H2 unless overridden), but no test-specific application.properties or @AutoConfigureTestDatabase override is present.
- Noted that H2 is included as a test dependency in build.gradle, so tests likely run against H2 by default.

**Next Steps:**
- Recommend explicitly configuring @AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.NONE) in repository tests to ensure they use PostgreSQL and enforce optimistic locking as in production.

---

Request: Update BlotterRepositoryTest to use PostgreSQL for optimistic locking tests and create a test properties file for the test datasource.

Actions:
1. Added @AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.NONE) to BlotterRepositoryTest to ensure it uses the real PostgreSQL database.
2. Created src/test/resources/application.properties with PostgreSQL datasource and Flyway configuration for integration tests.

---

Request: Fix optimistic concurrency so that JPA manages the version field and exceptions are thrown as expected.

Actions:
1. Removed the line that manually set the version in BlotterServiceImpl.updateBlotter. Now, only JPA manages the version field, enabling proper optimistic locking and exception handling.

---

Request: Fix optimistic concurrency test to ensure the stale entity scenario is properly simulated and exceptions are thrown as expected.

Actions:
1. Updated testOptimisticConcurrency in BlotterRepositoryTest to use entityManager.clear() instead of entityManager.detach(b2), ensuring b2 is truly stale.
2. Ensured the test method does not use @Transactional, so each saveAndFlush is in its own transaction and version increments are visible to subsequent operations.

---

Request: Update optimistic concurrency test to explicitly set a stale version on the entity after clearing the persistence context, ensuring Hibernate detects the version conflict.

Actions:
1. Modified testOptimisticConcurrency in BlotterRepositoryTest to reload b2 after clearing the persistence context and set its version to 1 (stale) before saving, so Hibernate will throw an OptimisticLockingFailureException as expected.

---

Request: Disable the optimistic concurrency test due to persistent failures with exception detection in the test environment.

Actions:
1. Commented out the testOptimisticConcurrency method and its @Test annotation in BlotterRepositoryTest, with a note explaining it is disabled due to persistent failures and to see cursor-log.md for details.

---

2. Updated BlotterServiceImpl to:
   - Cache getAllBlotters() and getBlotterById(id) using @Cacheable (cache name: 'blotters').
   - Evict all entries from the 'blotters' cache on create, update, and delete using @CacheEvict.
3. Ensured consistency with other cache implementations in the codebase.

---

Request: Implement unit testing for blotter caching (step 12 in execution-plan.md).

Actions:
1. Added unit tests to BlotterServiceImplTest to verify Caffeine-based caching for BlotterService:
   - testGetBlotterByIdUsesCache: Ensures getBlotterById uses the cache.
   - testGetAllBlottersUsesCache: Ensures getAllBlotters uses the cache.
   - testCacheEvictedOnCreateUpdateDelete: Ensures create, update, and delete evict the cache as expected.
2. Used @DirtiesContext to reset the cache between tests and injected CacheManager for direct cache inspection.

---

Request: Fix version mismatch error in BlotterServiceImplTest cache eviction test.

Actions:
1. Updated testCacheEvictedOnCreateUpdateDelete to reload the Blotter entity from the repository after update, so the correct (latest) version is passed to deleteBlotter, avoiding version mismatch errors.

---

2. Used BlotterService and DTOs for request/response mapping.
3. Ensured consistency with codebase conventions and requirements.

---

Request: Generate tests for the new BlotterController endpoints.

Actions:
1. Created BlotterControllerTest in src/test/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/ covering:
