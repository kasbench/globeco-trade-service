# Cursor Activity Log

## Entry 1
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**User Request:** Please proceed with Phase 1 of @supplemental-requirement-7.md
**Action Taken:** Implementing Phase 1 of supplemental requirement 7 - Automated Execution Submission. This involves modifying the TradeOrderService.submitTradeOrder() method signature to include noExecuteSubmit parameter, implementing execution submission logic with compensating transaction rollback, adding retry logic with exponential backoff, and updating BatchTradeOrderService to support the new parameter.
**Files Modified:** 
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/TradeOrderService.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/TradeOrderServiceImpl.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/BatchTradeOrderService.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/config/RetryConfig.java
**Outcome:** Phase 1 service layer implementation completed successfully. Updated TradeOrderService interface to include noExecuteSubmit parameter with default method for backward compatibility, modified TradeOrderServiceImpl to implement automated execution submission with retry logic and compensating transactions, enhanced RetryConfig with exponential backoff configuration, and updated BatchTradeOrderService to support the new parameter. All changes compile successfully.


## Entry 2
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**User Request:** Please update the execution plan to show that phase 1 is complete and then proceed to phase 2. Update the execution plan when complete.
**Action Taken:** Completed Phase 2 - Controller Layer Updates. Updated TradeOrderController.submitTradeOrder() to accept noExecuteSubmit query parameter with proper error handling for execution service failures. Updated BatchTradeOrderController.batchSubmit() to accept noExecuteSubmit query parameter. Added enhanced error handling to distinguish between client errors (400) and server errors (500) from execution service calls.
**Files Modified:** 
- documentation/supplemental-requirement-7.md (execution plan updated)
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/TradeOrderController.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/controller/BatchTradeOrderController.java
**Outcome:** Phase 2 controller layer implementation completed successfully


## Entry 3
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**User Request:** Please proceed to phase 3. Update the execution plan when complete.
**Action Taken:** Completed Phase 3 - Testing. Added comprehensive unit tests for TradeOrderServiceImpl covering noExecuteSubmit=false/true scenarios, compensating transaction rollback scenarios, retry logic failure scenarios, and various error conditions. Added integration tests for TradeOrderController covering new noExecuteSubmit parameter functionality, execution service error handling, and compensating transaction verification. All tests compile successfully.
**Files Modified:** 
- documentation/supplemental-requirement-7.md (execution plan updated)
- src/test/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/TradeOrderServiceImplTest.java
- src/test/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/TradeOrderControllerTest.java
**Outcome:** Phase 3 testing implementation completed successfully with comprehensive test coverage


## 2025-06-19 09:15:00 - Supplemental Requirement 7 Implementation

**Request**: Investigate and fix failing tests after implementing supplemental requirement 7 for automated execution submission.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - Fixed ALL 5 failing tests (100% Complete!)

**Actions Taken**:
1. **Analyzed failing tests**: Initially had 5 failing tests related to new functionality
   - TradeOrderControllerTest.testSubmitTradeOrder_Success() - ✅ FIXED
   - TradeOrderControllerTest.testSubmitTradeOrder_CompensatingTransactionVerification() - ✅ FIXED
   - TradeOrderServiceImplTest.testSubmitTradeOrder_ExceedsAvailableQuantity() - ✅ FIXED  
   - TradeOrderServiceImplTest.testSubmitTradeOrder_CompensatingTransactionOnExecutionServiceFailure() - ✅ FIXED
   - TradeOrderServiceImplTest.testSubmitTradeOrder_CompensatingTransactionOnExecutionServiceException() - ✅ FIXED

2. **Fixed ExecutionService mocking issue** (Test 1):
   - Problem: Tests weren't properly mocking ExecutionService for new default behavior
   - Solution: Added proper ExecutionService.SubmitResult mocking in success scenarios

3. **Fixed BigDecimal comparison issues** (Tests 5 & Controller):
   - Problem: `assertEquals(originalQuantitySent, compensatedTradeOrder.getQuantitySent())` comparing `0` with `0E-8`
   - Solution: Changed to `assertEquals(0, originalQuantitySent.compareTo(compensatedTradeOrder.getQuantitySent()))`

4. **Fixed execution record accumulation issue** (Tests 2,3,4):
   - Problem: Execution records from previous tests were accumulating, causing assertions to fail
   - Root Cause: Tests without @Transactional don't auto-cleanup, and mock state was bleeding
   - Solution: Added `executionRepository.deleteAll()` and `reset(executionService)` in @BeforeEach methods

5. **Fixed test interference between service and controller tests**:
   - Problem: Controller tests also suffered from execution record accumulation
   - Solution: Added execution repository cleanup to TradeOrderControllerTest @BeforeEach

**Final Result**: 
- **All 229 tests passing** ✅
- **0 test failures** 
- **Supplemental Requirement 7 Phase 3 testing complete**

**Technical Notes**:
- Removed @Transactional from compensating transaction tests to allow proper rollback testing
- Added comprehensive mock reset and database cleanup between tests in both service and controller test classes
- Fixed BigDecimal scale comparison issues with proper compareTo() usage
- Ensured test isolation to prevent interference between test execution

**Build Status**: BUILD SUCCESSFUL ✅
