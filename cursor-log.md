Action: Updated the log to record the request. Next, I will:
1. Generate entity classes for Security and SecurityType based on the OpenAPI spec.
2. Create a service interface for fetching securities and security types.
3. Implement the service using a REST client to call the security service's GET endpoints.
4. Implement caching for these calls using Spring's caching abstraction, with a 5 minute EOL as specified in requirements.md.

---

Request: Please implement the entity, repository, service interface, and service implementation for blotter using the requirements provided in requirements.md. Please add an entry with this prompt and your actions in the cursor-log.md file following the instructions in the file. Do not delete or replace anything in cursor-log.md

Action: Updated the log to record the request. Next, I will:
1. Implement the Blotter entity class.
2. Create a JPA repository interface for Blotter.
3. Create a service interface for Blotter operations.
4. Implement the service class for Blotter, following the requirements and conventions in requirements.md.

---

Request: Please implement the unit tests for the entity, repository, service interface, and service implementation for blotter. Please add an entry with this prompt and your actions in the cursor-log.md file following the instructions in the file. Do not delete or replace anything in cursor-log.md

Action: Updated the log to record the request. Next, I will:
1. Implement unit tests for the Blotter entity (basic construction, getters/setters, equals/hashCode).
2. Implement unit tests for BlotterRepository (CRUD operations, optimistic concurrency).
3. Implement unit tests for BlotterService and BlotterServiceImpl (service logic, optimistic concurrency, error handling).

---

**Request:** Troubleshoot why optimistic concurrency tests for the Blotter entity are not throwing exceptions as expected. Investigate test configuration, entity setup, and test code.

**Actions:**
- Searched for optimistic concurrency test code in repository and service layer tests.
- Reviewed Blotter entity for @Version annotation and configuration.
- Checked main and test datasource configuration for H2 or PostgreSQL usage.
- Confirmed that @DataJpaTest is used (defaults to H2 unless overridden), but no test-specific application.properties or @AutoConfigureTestDatabase override is present.
- Noted that H2 is included as a test dependency in build.gradle, so tests likely run against H2 by default.

**Next Steps:**
- Recommend explicitly configuring @AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.NONE) in repository tests to ensure they use PostgreSQL and enforce optimistic locking as in production.

---

Request: Update BlotterRepositoryTest to use PostgreSQL for optimistic locking tests and create a test properties file for the test datasource.

Actions:
1. Added @AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = AutoConfigureTestDatabase.Replace.NONE) to BlotterRepositoryTest to ensure it uses the real PostgreSQL database.
2. Created src/test/resources/application.properties with PostgreSQL datasource and Flyway configuration for integration tests.

---

Request: Fix optimistic concurrency so that JPA manages the version field and exceptions are thrown as expected.

Actions:
1. Removed the line that manually set the version in BlotterServiceImpl.updateBlotter. Now, only JPA manages the version field, enabling proper optimistic locking and exception handling.

---

Request: Fix optimistic concurrency test to ensure the stale entity scenario is properly simulated and exceptions are thrown as expected.

Actions:
1. Updated testOptimisticConcurrency in BlotterRepositoryTest to use entityManager.clear() instead of entityManager.detach(b2), ensuring b2 is truly stale.
2. Ensured the test method does not use @Transactional, so each saveAndFlush is in its own transaction and version increments are visible to subsequent operations.

---

Request: Update optimistic concurrency test to explicitly set a stale version on the entity after clearing the persistence context, ensuring Hibernate detects the version conflict.

Actions:
1. Modified testOptimisticConcurrency in BlotterRepositoryTest to reload b2 after clearing the persistence context and set its version to 1 (stale) before saving, so Hibernate will throw an OptimisticLockingFailureException as expected.

---

Request: Disable the optimistic concurrency test due to persistent failures with exception detection in the test environment.

Actions:
1. Commented out the testOptimisticConcurrency method and its @Test annotation in BlotterRepositoryTest, with a note explaining it is disabled due to persistent failures and to see cursor-log.md for details.

---

Request: Implement caching for blotter using the requirements in requirements.md (step 11 in execution-plan.md).

Actions:
1. Renamed SecurityCacheConfig to CacheConfig and added a 'blotters' cache to the CaffeineCacheManager with a 5 minute TTL.
2. Updated BlotterServiceImpl to:
   - Cache getAllBlotters() and getBlotterById(id) using @Cacheable (cache name: 'blotters').
   - Evict all entries from the 'blotters' cache on create, update, and delete using @CacheEvict.
3. Ensured consistency with other cache implementations in the codebase.

---

Request: Implement unit testing for blotter caching (step 12 in execution-plan.md).

Actions:
1. Added unit tests to BlotterServiceImplTest to verify Caffeine-based caching for BlotterService:
   - testGetBlotterByIdUsesCache: Ensures getBlotterById uses the cache.
   - testGetAllBlottersUsesCache: Ensures getAllBlotters uses the cache.
   - testCacheEvictedOnCreateUpdateDelete: Ensures create, update, and delete evict the cache as expected.
2. Used @DirtiesContext to reset the cache between tests and injected CacheManager for direct cache inspection.

---

Request: Fix version mismatch error in BlotterServiceImplTest cache eviction test.

Actions:
1. Updated testCacheEvictedOnCreateUpdateDelete to reload the Blotter entity from the repository after update, so the correct (latest) version is passed to deleteBlotter, avoiding version mismatch errors.

---

Request: Implement BlotterController with REST endpoints for CRUD operations (step 13 in requirements.md).

Actions:
1. Created BlotterController in the main package with the following endpoints:
   - GET /api/v1/blotters: List all blotters.
   - GET /api/v1/blotters/{id}: Get a blotter by ID.
   - POST /api/v1/blotters: Create a new blotter.
   - PUT /api/v1/blotters/{id}: Update an existing blotter.
   - DELETE /api/v1/blotters/{id}?version=...: Delete a blotter by ID and version.
2. Used BlotterService and DTOs for request/response mapping.
3. Ensured consistency with codebase conventions and requirements.

---

Request: Generate tests for the new BlotterController endpoints.

Actions:
1. Created BlotterControllerTest in src/test/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/ covering:
   - GET /api/v1/blotters (all)
   - GET /api/v1/blotters/{id}
   - POST /api/v1/blotters
   - PUT /api/v1/blotters/{id}
   - DELETE /api/v1/blotters/{id}?version=...
2. Used @SpringBootTest, @AutoConfigureMockMvc, and MockMvc for endpoint testing.
3. Verified status codes and response bodies for success and not found cases.
4. Ensured consistency with other test classes.
