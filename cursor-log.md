## Entry 1
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**User Request:** Please proceed with Phase 1 of @supplemental-requirement-7.md
**Action Taken:** Implementing Phase 1 of supplemental requirement 7 - Automated Execution Submission. This involves modifying the TradeOrderService.submitTradeOrder() method signature to include noExecuteSubmit parameter, implementing execution submission logic with compensating transaction rollback, adding retry logic with exponential backoff, and updating BatchTradeOrderService to support the new parameter.
**Files Modified:** 
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/TradeOrderService.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/TradeOrderServiceImpl.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/BatchTradeOrderService.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/config/RetryConfig.java
**Outcome:** Phase 1 service layer implementation completed successfully. Updated TradeOrderService interface to include noExecuteSubmit parameter with default method for backward compatibility, modified TradeOrderServiceImpl to implement automated execution submission with retry logic and compensating transactions, enhanced RetryConfig with exponential backoff configuration, and updated BatchTradeOrderService to support the new parameter. All changes compile successfully.


## Entry 2
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**User Request:** Please update the execution plan to show that phase 1 is complete and then proceed to phase 2. Update the execution plan when complete.
**Action Taken:** Completed Phase 2 - Controller Layer Updates. Updated TradeOrderController.submitTradeOrder() to accept noExecuteSubmit query parameter with proper error handling for execution service failures. Updated BatchTradeOrderController.batchSubmit() to accept noExecuteSubmit query parameter. Added enhanced error handling to distinguish between client errors (400) and server errors (500) from execution service calls.
**Files Modified:** 
- documentation/supplemental-requirement-7.md (execution plan updated)
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/TradeOrderController.java
- src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/controller/BatchTradeOrderController.java
**Outcome:** Phase 2 controller layer implementation completed successfully


## Entry 3
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**User Request:** Please proceed to phase 3. Update the execution plan when complete.
**Action Taken:** Completed Phase 3 - Testing. Added comprehensive unit tests for TradeOrderServiceImpl covering noExecuteSubmit=false/true scenarios, compensating transaction rollback scenarios, retry logic failure scenarios, and various error conditions. Added integration tests for TradeOrderController covering new noExecuteSubmit parameter functionality, execution service error handling, and compensating transaction verification. All tests compile successfully.
**Files Modified:** 
- documentation/supplemental-requirement-7.md (execution plan updated)
- src/test/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/service/TradeOrderServiceImplTest.java
- src/test/java/org/kasbench/globeco_trade_service/TradeOrderControllerTest.java
**Outcome:** Phase 3 testing implementation completed successfully with comprehensive test coverage
